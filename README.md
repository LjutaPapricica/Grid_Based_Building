# Grid_Based_Building
How to build single buildings on a grid system. Like in Clash Of Clans.


-Exported this as a Unity package as it seemed like the easies way to import it into your project.

-Pay special attention to the tags and layers of each object

-Look at the Example scene to get an idea of how every thing is set up

-Package includes all scripts, prefabs, and materials that I used in the tutorial video. 

-Remember that the "preview" object needs a box collider and a rigidbody

-All code is commented to help you understand how the scripts work
